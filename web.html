								<h3>Leadership</h3>
								<p>I was asked by the president of Bisk to create a vehicle for launching the newest arm of his company. The video that my team and I came up with still gives me chills. Our music selection provides the viewer with a sense of uplifting energy and hearing him discuss his vision set to the amazing sights all over the world is something that is not easy to forget.</p>

								<p>Once the experience was completely mapped out and the numerous prototypes were approved, I handled all the front-end development of the site in an Angular.js architecture.</p>
								<p>As we worked more and more with Angular.js, we realized that we could push more of our client work into an angular architecture and streamline our development efforts.</p>

								<h3>Strategy</h3>
								<p>As the digital user experience lead at Kobie Marketing, I guided our client and our designers toward an elegant and functional experience that allows users quick and easy access to their loyalty information and brand messaging that's relevant to them.</p>
								<p>As our team concepted each iteration, I was able to rapidly prototype the app to ensure that form followed functionality.</p>

								<h3>Concepting</h3>
								<p>Working closely with the Verizon team and our internal designers I helped create experience maps that led to this award-winning website. Within weeks of its launch, we saw a dramatic increase in engagment metrics as well as drastically fewer customer complaints.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>Development</h3>
								<p>As we needed this site to be ready fast, we leaned heavily on a newer front-end framework that Verizon is now including as a requirement for all their digital assets. Being the guinnea pig with this framework allowed us a lot of insight into modular development. </p>

						</ul>
						<p>My team owning a large portion of this project allowed me a huge source of pride. Our Agile group designed, developed and tested this project from concept to completion and received a large amount of press for their effort. Young Africa Rising helped put our digital group on the map.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>Strategy</h3>
								<p>One of the benefits of this project was our team's ability to utilize a completely agile development process. We trained under some of the best Agile coaches and certified Scrum Masters and shipped incredible design and code.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>Leadership</h3>
								<p>As a leader, you can't always tell someone the answer. You need to teach your team to find the answer on their own. This project showed me how much my team could accomplish if given the right pushes at the right times and the right restrictions when necessary.</p>

						<p>Leading a team of 8 front-end developers and user experience designers, I was able to step back and start to test the success of designs and experiences.</p>
						<div class="row">
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>Testing/Analysis</h3>
								<p>Through the help of an amazing suite of testing tools, my team and I were able to increase conversion rates on nearly every lead-form used by the University of Notre Dame's Mendoza College of Business.</p>
							</div>
							<div class="6u 12u(mobilep)">
								<h3>Design/Development</h3>
								<p>For the University, we used an iterative and highly-fluid approach to design. I ensured that no one became married to their designs. Instead, we ruthlessly prioritized areas to improve and never stopped at "good enough." </p>

						<p>One of my main tasks in managing my experience &amp; development team was producing reuable and customizable assets for rapid releases. I created a template for Villanova which was taken and tweaked in hundreds of different ways. With thorough testing and anaysis, we found that it out-performed designs that had been in use for years. </p>
